        My name is Kalina Kraleva-a graphic artist in particular. I was born in Sofia in the year of 1983 on 19th of March. My education was and still is a long weaving road passing through different fields of activity. Finally it stopped in National Academy of Arts in Sofia. In 2012 I take my Master Degree of Printing techniques and Graphic art. From that moment on I’m exploring the depths of printmaking every day hoping to develop all my life. The rest of my presentation are the images themselves. So I will let them speaking instead of me. Welcome!

        "I am going to tell a short story of my  life till present time. I was born in Sofia on 19 March 1983 in a family of architects. When I finished my high school education, my parents suggested that I study architecture so I studied for two years in Sofia, Bulgaria. Unfortunately I was not confident in this field and always felt a kind of emptiness. Struggling with myself, I suddenly took a decision to change my direction in life. (…) I involved myself deeply in pure art and after two years of preparation finally was admitted to the Printing Art Department of the University.

        Now I continue to follow my dreams and to work hard, trying to take part in various exhibitions . Since 2013 till now I was given several commissions for ex libris and small print…"
